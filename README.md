# Comp 133 Final: Fluffy the EV3 dog
## Designed to teach robotics to children through exploration

### By Hailey Mckelvie and Grace Melcher

Fluffy is aimed at teaching students in Kindergarten through Second Grade about robotics. Children are able to learn about robotic sensors and their uses through interacting with Fluffy. Fluffy contains three different types of sensors: touch, distance, and color. The students can discover the uses of each sensor through experimenting with Fluffy and following the prompts that Fluffy gives. Students leave interactions with Fluffy with an increase knowledge of robotics, specifically how robots learn information through sensors.

The state diagram of Fluffy can be viewed in HRI_robot_interaction_flow.png. 	

Fluffy is intended to be open source and accessible. All materials used to build Fluffy are in Lego's EV3 robotics kit, and the code to run Fluffy is publically available. The architecture of Fluffy is adapted from the EV3 Puppy to include the ultrasonic sensor on the upper left side and a touch sensor as its back tail, replacing the prevous rotating ball tail.
